# Generic FA2 and FA2.1

This module implements the last [FA2.1 proposition](balance_of address old_value in).

The current implementation covers:
- multi-asset,
- single-asset and
- NFT.

## Internal Design

Contracts use the same code but specific behaviors are given thanks to a record type (kind of module)
